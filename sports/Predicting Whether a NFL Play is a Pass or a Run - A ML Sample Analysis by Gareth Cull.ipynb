    "While browsing online for open football datasets, I came across a really interesting one on data.world ([1]) . For each row within this dataset, there is an offensive play detailing information such as where each play took place on the field, what down it was, how many yards to go, and whether it was a pass or run. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often times when I am watching football, I find myself predicting whether or not the next play is going to be a run or a pass. And while I don't actually track how successful I am at these predictions, I started to wonder if I could apply some of my newly acquired Machine Learning knowledge and use an algorithm to predict whether or not a particular play was a pass or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the objective of this analysis is to see how accurate a ML algorithm is at predicting whether or not the play in question is a Pass or a Run.\n",

    "\n",
    "Using a DecisionTree Algorithm from sklearn, an unoptimized ML model successfully predicted that a play in question was a Pass or a Run 65% of the time! If you were to only guess passing downs for every play, you would be correct 59% of the time given that is the proportion of passes for the 2016 season. The algorithm improves on that baseline by 10%. \n",

    "Further hyper-parameter optimizations using Grid Search improved the accuracy score of the model by 2 points to 67%. \n",

    "Overall, this was a fun excercise to see if I could use machine learning to determine how accurate a model could predict whether or not a given play was a pass or a run. It was interesting to see that the algorithm successfully predicted the scenerio 67% of the time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The top 5 most predictive features when determining whether or not a play is a pass or a run include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Down Distance to First Down<br>\n",
    "2) Down<br>\n",
    "3) Time remaining on the clock<br>\n",
    "4) Opponents Score<br>\n",
    "5) Quarter<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Future analysis considerations should include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build out functions to test additional models such as Random Forest.\n",
    "- Segment the data to see how predictions perform on specific scenerios (eg. redzone)\n",
    "- Create a scenerio calculator to explore how teams play in different situations. \n",
    "- Conduct a QB analysis around specific scenerios.\n",
